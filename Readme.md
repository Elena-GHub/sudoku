# sudoku
Project made during my bootcamp at Factor√≠a F5.  
Team project (5 coders team "Clean Coders")
Desktop app to play Sudoku.

Notes:  10 day sprint using Golang, Vue and Wails framework for the first time
No TDD, too much time needed in learning spikes in one sprint.
STATUS: Unfinished. We did not manage to get the input from the player.
Command to build app in VS Code terminal:
    `wails build`
Then simply run the .exe file in the build folder.
